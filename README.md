2. [Handling missing values](#handling-missing-values)
3. [Exploratory Data Analysis](#EDA)<br>
       3.1. [Descriptive Statistics](#descriptive-statistics)<br>
       3.2. [Univariate Analysis](#univariate-analysis)<br>
       3.3. [Bivariate Analysis](#bivariate-analysis)

## 1. Importing Libraries
Below packages were installed and imported for this analysis:

       - readxl: Read and import Excel files into R.
       - ggplot2: Create static, animated, and interactive data visualizations in R.
       - dplyr: Perform data manipulation and transformation in R.
       - reshape2: Reshape and transform data in R.

## 2. Handling Missing Values
There are 6 features in the data:
<br> 1. Age
<br> 2. Gender
<br> 3. Education Level
<br> 4. Job Title
<br> 5. Years of Experience
<br> 6. Salary

Missing values in any row were observed and these rows were dropped before proceeding with Visualizations.

## 3. EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis on the cleaned data was performed.
